# Agent Skills

**Production-grade engineering skills for AI coding agents.**

Skills encode the workflows, quality gates, and best practices that senior engineers use when building software. These ones are packaged so AI agents follow them consistently across every phase of development.

## Commands

9 slash commands that map to the development lifecycle. Each one activates the right skills automatically.

| What you're doing | Command | Key principle |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| Define what to build | `/spec` | Spec before code |
| Plan how to build it | `/plan` | Small, atomic tasks |
| Build incrementally | `/build` | One slice at a time |
| Prove it works | `/test` | Tests are proof |
| Set the quality bar | `/constraints` | Decide it once, enforce it everywhere |
| Review before merge | `/review` | Improve code health |
| Audit web performance | `/webperf` | Measure before you optimize |
| Simplify the code | `/code-simplify` | Clarity over cleverness |
| Ship to production | `/ship` | Faster is safer |

In Claude Code these install as plugin commands. Where a built-in command has the same name, as `/review` does, use the namespaced form: `/agent-skills:review`.

Want fewer manual steps once the spec exists? **`/build auto`** generates the plan and implements every task in a single approved pass — you approve the plan once, then it runs autonomously. It removes the human stepping *between* tasks, not the verification: every task is still test-driven and committed individually, and it pauses on failures or risky steps.

Skills also activate automatically based on what you're doing — designing an API triggers `api-and-interface-design`, building UI triggers `frontend-ui-engineering`, and so on.

## Quick Start

**Fastest path — any agent, one command.** The open [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) installs into 70+ agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Cline, and more):

```bash
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills            # install all 25 skills
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills --list     # browse before installing
```

Or grab individual skills:

```bash
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills --skill code-review-and-quality   # five-axis review before merge
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills --skill interview-me              # requirements interrogation, one question at a time
npx skills add addyosmani/agent-skills --skill test-driven-development   # red-green-refactor, enforced
```
